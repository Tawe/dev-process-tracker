# Dev Process Tracker

Dev Process Tracker (`devpt`) helps you track and control local dev services from one place.

## Copilot CLI Challenge Submission Prep

If you are submitting this repo to the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge (submission deadline: **February 15, 2026, 11:59 PM PT**), use these repo docs:

- `CHALLENGE_CHECKLIST.md` - final pre-submit checklist
- `HOW_COPILOT_CLI_WAS_USED.md` - evidence of Copilot CLI usage during development
- `ATTRIBUTION.md` - third-party code/inspiration disclosure
- `LICENSE` - project license (MIT)

## What it does

- Opens an interactive TUI by default (`devpt`)
- Shows running services with name, port, pid, project, command, and health
- Tracks managed services you register with `devpt add`
- Lets you start, restart, stop, remove, and inspect services
- Provides logs for managed services and best-effort logs for unmanaged processes
- Marks managed services as `crashed` when they exit unexpectedly and shows an inferred crash reason

## Install

```bash
go build -o devpt ./cmd/devpt
```

## Run tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Challenge smoke test

Run a full checklist-oriented smoke flow in an isolated temp home:

```bash
./scripts/challenge_smoke_test.sh
```

This runs `build`, `test`, and core command flow: `add`, `start`, `status`, `logs`, `restart`, `ls`, and `stop`.

## Quick start

```bash
# Open the TUI (default)
devpt

# Register a service
devpt add my-app ~/projects/my-app "npm run dev" 3000

# Start / stop / restart
devpt start my-app
devpt stop my-app
devpt restart my-app

# Logs
devpt logs my-app --lines 100
```

## CLI commands

### Default

```bash
devpt
```

Opens the interactive monitor.

### Manage services

```bash
devpt add <name> <cwd> "<cmd>" [ports...]
devpt start <name>
devpt stop <name>
devpt stop --port <port>
devpt restart <name>
devpt logs <name> [--lines N]
```

### Inspect

```bash
devpt ls [--details]
devpt status <name|port>
```

`devpt status <name>` now includes a `CRASH DETAILS` section for crashed managed services, including an inferred reason and recent log lines.

### Meta

```bash
devpt help
devpt --version
```

## TUI keymap

- `Tab`: switch focus between running and managed lists
- `Enter`:
  - running list: open logs
  - managed list: start selected service
- `Ctrl+E`: stop selected running service (with confirm)
- `Ctrl+R`: restart selected running managed service
- `Ctrl+A`: open command input (`add ...` prefilled)
- `x` / `Delete` / `Ctrl+D`: remove selected managed service (with confirm)
- `/`: open filter input
- `Ctrl+L`: clear filter
- `s`: cycle sort mode
- `h`: toggle health detail
- `?`: open help
- `b`: back from logs/command
- `f`: toggle log follow mode (in logs view)
- `q`: quit

## TUI command input

Inside TUI command mode (`:` or `Ctrl+A`), supported commands:

```text
add <name> <cwd> "<cmd>" [ports...]
start <name>
stop <name|--port PORT>
remove <name>
restore <name>
list
help
```

## AI Agent Detection

Dev Process Tracker can identify servers started by AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.). Detected servers show `agent:name` in the source column instead of `manual`.

### Detection methods

1. **Parent process name** - If parent process is named `claude`, `cursor`, `copilot`, etc., it's detected as AI-started
2. **Environment variables** - Detects `CLAUDE_*`, `CURSOR_*`, `COPILOT_*` env var prefixes (Linux only; macOS uses parent process check only)

### Naming convention for AI-managed services

When registering managed services with `devpt add`, use a naming prefix to indicate ownership:

```bash
# Services started by Claude
devpt add claude-frontend ~/projects/frontend "npm run dev" 3000
devpt add claude-api ~/projects/backend "go run main.go" 8000

# Services started by Cursor
devpt add cursor-worker ~/projects/worker "npm start" 4000

# Services started by Copilot
devpt add copilot-service ~/projects/service "python app.py" 5000
```

When you use `devpt start` on these services, the naming makes it clear which AI agent manages them in the registry.

### Example: Testing with built-in test servers

The `sandbox/servers/` directory includes test servers for experimenting:

```bash
# From repo root, register test servers with AI owner names
devpt add claude-node ./sandbox/servers/node-basic "npm run dev" 3100
devpt add claude-python ./sandbox/servers/python-basic "python3 server.py" 3300
devpt add cursor-go ./sandbox/servers/go-basic "go run main.go" 3400
devpt add copilot-node-fallback ./sandbox/servers/node-port-fallback "npm run dev" 3200
devpt add claude-node-crash ./sandbox/servers/node-crash "npm run dev" 3500
devpt add cursor-node-warnings ./sandbox/servers/node-warnings "npm run dev" 3600

# Start them
devpt start claude-node
devpt start claude-python
devpt start cursor-go
devpt start copilot-node-fallback
devpt start claude-node-crash
devpt start cursor-node-warnings

# View in devpt TUI
devpt
```

Each test server exposes `/health` (JSON) and `/` (plain text) endpoints.

## Notes

- Managed services are registry entries you control via `devpt`.
- Running list is process-driven. Managed services can appear even before a port is bound.
- If stop needs elevated permissions, TUI asks for confirmation to run `sudo kill -9 <pid>`.
- Service names can include a prefix (e.g., `claude-`, `cursor-`, `copilot-`) to indicate AI agent ownership in your registry.
- No login or API credentials are required for judges to run this project locally.

## Troubleshooting

### Service not appearing

Check running listeners:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Check registry entry:

```bash
devpt ls --details
```

### Process won’t stop

Try from TUI first (`Ctrl+E`). If escalation is required, run:

```bash
sudo kill -9 <pid>
```

### Logs unavailable for unmanaged process

Some processes only write to attached terminal output. In that case there may be nothing tail-able from files/unified logs.
